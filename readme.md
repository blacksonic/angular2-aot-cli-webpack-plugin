This repository shows how to use the Angular CLI Webpack plugin (`@ngtools/webpack`) to achieve AOT offline compilation.

It can also work with the new `@utlimate/aot-loader` package and has very similar configuration.
See example in [separate branch](https://github.com/blacksonic/angular2-aot-cli-webpack-plugin/tree/ultimate).

> If you prefer the command line tool (```ngc```) provided by Angular, 
it can be found in a [separate repository](https://github.com/blacksonic/angular2-aot-webpack).

The application consists of 
a module (```src/app/modules/main.module.ts```)
and a basic component (```src/app/components/hello-world.component.ts```) 
with template (```src/app/components/hello-world.template.pug```) 
and component specific style (```src/app/components/hello-world.style.sass```).

When the application starts (```npm start```) 
it generates the compiled files in memory 
and replaces the bootstrap logic to use the generated ```NgFactory``` files.

The application is bundled with Webpack from the main file and is available on ```http://localhost:9000```.

### Advantages

- Custom file types available for templates and styles through Webpack loaders (sass, pug,...)
- No separate process for compilation
- Watch mode for AOT compiled files
- No need to maintain AOT version of bootstrap file
- No output to disk for separate ```*.ngfactory.ts``` files during compilation

### Disadvantages

- Need to wait for new versions after Angular release to Angular CLI repository catch up
- Not good for AOT compatible package publishing, because it doesn't output separate compiled files
